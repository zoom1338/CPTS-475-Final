# Meeting Notes 10/20/2025 w/ James Halverson

* Looking at the datset contained here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/nfuqnidsv2-network-intrusion-detection-dataset/data

* discussed the types of GANs we can possibly use a modigifed Contional Tabular GAN : https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN

* Other GAN Types availble https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN

* evaluation method to be determined ie TSTR, classifier method>

* Frechet inception distance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9chet_inception_distance

* Write-up apply themethods and see how the best work, if dataset isn't imporved we still have work to discuss and show, experimenting and reesearch is the core ofhte assignment not having and the absolute end result.
